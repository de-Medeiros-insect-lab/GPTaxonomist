Body size (length of elytra + pronotum) 4.3–5.5 mm.
Head: Rostrum 1.0–1.1 times as long as pronotum; 1.2–1.4 times wider at apex than at base; with integument
yellowish to dark brown; with seven longitudinal carinae (including a pair along scrobes), distinct throughout their length; scrobes parallel to rostrum; apex covered by microsetae; areas between carinae covered by yellowish to brown scales, scales wide and distinctively narrower towards the apex of rostrum, directed toward the central carina. Eyes 1.5–1.8 times as high as wide; 0.6–0.9 times more separated above than below. Head with integument yellow- ish to dark brown, similar to rostrum; entirely covered by yellowish large scales or with yellowish large scales only near the eyes and on the sides and dark microsetae elsewhere; scales directed to a point basal to the inter-ocular fo- vea. Antennae with scape straight, barely reaching anterior eye margin; funicle: antennomere I only slightly wider than II, II about as long as I, and about 2 times as long as III; VI as wide as long, and narrower than club; club about as long as antennomeres V–VI of funicle. Left mandible straight on outer margin straight; with one dorsal seta;
outer tooth evenly connected to the mandible margin, not forming a sharp angle, rounded at apex; inner tooth absent or weakly developed; molar region straight. Left maxilla with stipes moderately elongate, with a long ventral seta; galeo-lacinial complex extending beyond the apex of palpomere I; palpiger with transverse ventral region, dorsal region forming an acute angle at base; palpomere I with two apical setae shorter than the length of palpomere I; palpomere II approximately as long as palpomere I. Labium with prementum almost as wide as postmentum, about 1.5 times as wide as long, lateral margins parallel in median region, with a right angle in lateral-apical region, with sparse setae, not arranged in rows; ligula present, but inconspicuous; palps separated by less than half the width of palpomere I; palpomere I transverse; palpomere II shorter than palpomere III; palpomere III with one lateral seta.
