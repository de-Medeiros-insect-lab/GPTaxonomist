FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final table output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final markdown table, nothing else.

TASK:
You are an expert taxonomist. Extract all morphological characters and their states from the taxonomic description below and organize them into a structured table.

TAXONOMIC DESCRIPTION:
```
${DESCRIPTION}
```

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Table Format**: Produce a markdown pipe table with two columns:
   - Column 1: Character name
   - Column 2: Observed state

2. **Character Name Format**: Use this hierarchical structure:
   [semaphoront], [major body area], [specific body area], [more specific area if any], [property] ([units if any])

   Examples:
   - "Adult male, head, vertex, punctation, density"
   - "Adult female, wing, hind wing, length (mm)"
   - "Larva, abdomen, tergite 3, setation"

3. **Character Granularity**:
   - One character per row
   - Each row describes a single property of a structure
   - Split multiple properties of the same structure into separate rows
   - Common properties: shape, size, color, texture, aspect, position, vestiture, punctation, setation, sculpture

4. **Parsing Logic**:
   - Replace "semaphoront" with the actual sex or life stage (e.g., "Adult male", "Female", "Larva")
   - Paragraphs typically group characters by major body area
   - Sentences typically group characters by specific body area
   - Semicolons within sentences often separate more specific areas
   - Be flexible - this structure may vary depending on the author

5. **Character Order**: Include every character in the same order as they appear in the original description

6. **Completeness**: Extract ALL characters from the description with no exceptions

7. **Language**: Output the entire table in ${LANGUAGE}

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Correct obvious typos and OCR errors
   - If measurement ranges are given (e.g., "3-5 mm"), keep them as ranges
   - If a state is implicit (e.g., "smooth" implies absence of punctation), extract it as stated

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
The following examples show the expected output structure. Your output should follow this format but contain only characters from the description above:

```
${EXAMPLE}
```

Do not include characters from the examples in your output. Only extract characters actually present in the description provided above.
