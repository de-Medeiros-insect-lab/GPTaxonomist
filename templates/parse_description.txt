Given the following taxonomic description in ${LANGUAGE}, extract a list of characters and their states.  The list must contain all characters in the description, with no exceptions. Correct typos if you see one.

As output, I want a table with one character per row. That means that each row contains a single property of a given structure. Each character will be formatted as follows:

Column 1: character name, with the following format: [major body area], [specific body area], [more specific body area, if any], [property] ([units, if any])

Column 2: observed character state

For body areas, use the first word in each paragraph to deduct the major body area. If you observe a typo, correct it.

```
${DESCRIPTION}
```

Here go a few examples of the kind of output I want, but your output should not include the example. Include every single character in the same order they are listed in the original description.

```
${EXAMPLE}
```
After you finish, explicitly say you are done.
