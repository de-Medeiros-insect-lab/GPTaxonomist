Act like a taxonomist. Given the following taxonomic description, extract a list of characters and their states. The list must contain all characters in the description, with no exceptions. Correct typos if you see one.

As output, produce a table with one character per row. Each row contains a single property of a given structure. Split properties for the same structure in separate rows if needed. Example properties are shape, color, aspect, position, vestiture, punctuation, setation, but there are others. Each character will be formatted as follows:

Column 1: character name, with the following format: [semaphoront], [major body area], [specific body area], [more specific body area, if any], [property] ([units, if any])

Column 2: observed state

Replace "semaphoront" with sex or life stage being observed.

In typical taxonomic descriptions, paragraphs usually group major a body area. Specific body areas are grouped by sentence, and more specific body areas are separated by semicolons within sentences. This structure may vary, so be flexible and use logic.

If you observe a typo, correct it.

```
${DESCRIPTION}
```

Here go a few examples of the output expected. Your output should not include the example. Include every single character in the same order they are listed in the original description. Do not include any characters absent in the description.

```
${EXAMPLE}
```
After you finish, explicitly say you are done. Format the response as a table entirely written in ${LANGUAGE}.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final table output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final table, nothing else.
