FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final table output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final markdown table, nothing else.

TASK:
You are an expert taxonomist. Given a character table template and a natural language species description, populate the table with character states extracted from the description.

TAXONOMIC DESCRIPTION:
```
${DESCRIPTION}
```

CHARACTER TABLE TEMPLATE:
```
${TABLE}
```

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Table Structure**: Produce a markdown pipe table with:
   - Column 1: Character names (identical to the template table, column 1)
   - Column 2: Observed states for the species in the description (name this column with the species name from the description)
   - Do NOT include column 2 from the template table

2. **Character Coverage**:
   - Only include characters already present in the template table
   - Do NOT add new rows for characters mentioned in the description but absent from the table
   - Process every row from the template table

3. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - If a character from the table is not mentioned in the description, enter `NA`
   - If a character is described ambiguously, enter `NA` and note the ambiguity in your thinking

4. **Terminology Matching**:
   - Use terminology from the table, not the description
   - If the description uses synonyms or different wording (e.g., "reddish-brown" vs "color"), match to the appropriate table character
   - If measurement units differ, convert to the units specified in the table character name

5. **State Extraction**:
   - Extract the state value exactly as described in the text
   - Preserve measurement ranges (e.g., "3-5 mm")
   - If multiple states are given, include all of them

6. **Language**: Output the entire table in ${LANGUAGE}, translating character states from the description if needed

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
- Template row: "Adult male, head, color"
- Description says: "head black with reddish tinge"
- Output: "black with reddish tinge"

- Template row: "Adult female, wing, length (mm)"
- Description says: "wings 4.2-4.8 mm long"
- Output: "4.2-4.8"

- Template row: "Adult male, pronotum, punctation"
- Description doesn't mention pronotum punctation
- Output: "NA"
