FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final table output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final markdown table, nothing else.

TASK:
You are an expert taxonomist. Compare two taxonomic descriptions and produce a side-by-side comparison table showing character states for both species.

DESCRIPTION 1:
```
${DESCRIPTION1}
```

DESCRIPTION 2:
```
${DESCRIPTION2}
```

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Table Format**: Produce a markdown pipe table with three columns:
   - Column 1: "Characters observed"
   - Column 2: Species name from description 1 (extract from text)
   - Column 3: Species name from description 2 (extract from text)

2. **Character Name Format**: Use this hierarchical structure in column 1:
   [semaphoront], [major body area], [specific body area], [more specific area if any], [property] ([units if any])

   Examples:
   - "Adult male, head, vertex, punctation, density"
   - "Adult female, wing, hind wing, length (mm)"
   - "Adult, thorax, pronotum, color"

3. **Character Granularity**:
   - One character per row
   - Each row compares a single property of a structure
   - Split multiple properties of the same structure into separate rows
   - Each row must compare the SAME property across both species
   - Common properties: shape, size, color, texture, aspect, position, vestiture, punctation, setation, sculpture

4. **Character Coverage**:
   ${INCLUDE_STATEMENT}

5. **Parsing Logic**:
   - Replace "semaphoront" with the actual sex or life stage (e.g., "Adult male", "Female", "Larva")
   - Paragraphs typically group characters by major body area
   - Sentences typically group characters by specific body area
   - Semicolons within sentences often separate more specific areas
   - Be flexible - this structure may vary depending on the author

6. **Character Alignment**:
   - Match equivalent characters even if described using different terminology
   - If one description uses "reddish-brown" and another uses "rufous", recognize these as the same character (color) with different states
   - Align measurement characters even if units or precision differ

7. **Language**: Output the entire table in ${LANGUAGE}

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Correct obvious typos and OCR errors
   - Descriptions may have been digitized with OCR and contain scanning errors
   - Preserve measurement ranges (e.g., "3-5 mm") as given
   - If a character state is ambiguous or unclear, include your best interpretation

EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
| Characters observed | Species A | Species B |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Adult male, head, vertex, color | black | reddish-brown |
| Adult male, head, vertex, punctation | densely punctate | sparsely punctate |
| Adult male, wing, fore wing, length (mm) | 4.2-4.8 | 3.8-4.1 |
