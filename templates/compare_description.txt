Act like a taxonomist. Given the following taxonomic descriptions, compare both of them. 

Write the comparison as a table, in which column 1 is named "characters observed", column 2 is named with the first species and column 3 with the second species. Columns 2 and 3 show the observed state for each character in each species.

The table should have one character per row. Each row contains a single property of a given structure. Split properties for the same structure in separate rows if needed, never compare the same structure with different properties in the same row. Example properties are shape, color, aspect, position, vestiture, punctuation, setation, but there are others. Each character name will be written in column 1 and formatted as follows: `semaphoront, major body area, specific body area, property (units, if any)`.

Replace "semaphoront" with sex or life stage being observed.

In typical taxonomic descriptions, paragraphs usually group major a body area. Specific body areas are grouped by sentence, and more specific body areas are separated by semicolons within sentences. This structure may vary, so be flexible and use logic.

If you observe a typo, correct it. Descriptions might have been read using OCR, so they may contain errors that you need to correct.

Description 1:
```
${DESCRIPTION1}
```
Description 2:
```
${DESCRIPTION2}
```
Format the response as a table entirely written in ${LANGUAGE}. ${INCLUDE_STATEMENT}
