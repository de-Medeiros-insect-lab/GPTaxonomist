FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final description output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final description prose, nothing else.
- If characters from the table are not in the template, list them as warnings in <thinking>, not in <results>.

TASK:
You are an expert taxonomist. Generate a publication-quality natural language taxonomic description from a character table, following the style and structure of a provided template description.

CHARACTER TABLE:
```
${CHARACTER_TABLE}
```

TEMPLATE DESCRIPTION:
```
${TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION}
```

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Writing Style**: Use telegraphic language typical of taxonomic descriptions
   - Omit articles (a, an, the) where conventional: "Head black" not "The head is black"
   - Use terse, precise phrasing: "punctate" not "covered with punctures"
   - Employ standard taxonomic terminology and abbreviations
   - Example: "Body elongate, black; head sparsely punctate; antennae filiform, 11-segmented."

2. **Template Adherence**:
   - Follow the template's organizational structure (paragraph breaks, section order)
   - Follow the template's punctuation style (semicolons, commas, periods)
   - Follow the template's character sequence
   - Match the template's level of detail and phrasing patterns

3. **Character States from Table**:
   - Use observed states ONLY from the character table
   - NEVER use state values from the template description
   - If the table says "black" and template says "brown", write "black"

4. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - If a character appears in the template but is not in the table (or is `NA`), skip it entirely
   - Do not write "not observed" or leave blanks - simply omit the character
   - Adjust punctuation smoothly when omitting characters (e.g., if skipping a semicolon-separated phrase)

5. **Handling Extra Characters**:
   - If a character exists in the table but not in the template, do NOT include it in the description
   - Note these extra characters in your <thinking> tags as warnings: "Warning: Character '[name]' from table not found in template"

6. **Character Order**:
   - Maintain the template's character sequence
   - When skipping unobserved characters, preserve the relative order of remaining characters

7. **Measurements and Formatting**:
   - Preserve measurement ranges from the table (e.g., "3.2-4.5 mm")
   - Use appropriate decimal places based on the table values
   - Include units as specified in the table

8. **Language**: Output the entire description in ${LANGUAGE}, translating character states if needed

EXAMPLE:
Template: "Body elongate, brown; head densely punctate; eyes large."
Table has: Body shape = "elongate", Body color = "black", Head punctation = "sparsely punctate"
(Eyes not in table)

Output: "Body elongate, black; head sparsely punctate."

Explanation:
- Kept structure from template
- Used "black" from table (not "brown" from template)
- Used "sparsely punctate" from table (not "densely punctate" from template)
- Omitted "eyes large" (not in table)
