Act like a taxonomist. Given the following table describing the characters for a species, produce a natural-language publication-quality taxonomic description

Table:
```
${CHARACTER_TABLE}
```

The resulting description must be consistent with the description of similar taxa. Here I provide the description of this other taxon as a template.

Template:
```
${TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION}
```

The result should strictly follow these rules:
- publication-quality description
- telegraphic language
- if a character state is not observed in the table, skip this character, do not mention it. Do not say it was not observed, just ignore it.
- if a character exists in the table but not the template, ignore it in the output description but raise a warning at the end.
- character names and order must follow the template, except for those not observed in the table.
- punctuation and line breaks must follow the template, skipping characters not observed in the table.
- observed states must follow the table, NOT the template. Never use observed states from the template.
- output language must be ${LANGUAGE}. Translate if needed.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to think through the problem or show your reasoning, wrap that content in <thinking></thinking> tags.
- Wrap your final description output in <results></results> tags.
- The content between <results></results> tags should contain ONLY the final description, nothing else.
